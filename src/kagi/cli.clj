(ns kagi.cli
  "`kagi` CLI — 1Password の `op` 相当。自己主権 + 対量子(PQC) vault をコマンドで操作する。

  保存先(カレント直下):
    .kagi/identity.edn  — actor の Ed25519/ML-DSA 鍵 + KEM 受信鍵(gitignore)
    .kagi/vault.edn     — 暗号文 item + wrap 済み鍵 + 台帳(平文・素 VMK は出ない)

  unlock: master passphrase → Argon2id(salt) → KEK → VMK(wrap 解除)。passphrase は
  環境変数 KAGI_MASTER か、無ければ端末プロンプト。

  使い方:
    kagi init                       # 鍵生成 + vault 作成(passphrase 設定)
    kagi add <name> [-c comp] [--category login] [--record refs.edn]
                                    # secret を stdin/プロンプトから登録
                                    # --category は kagitaba の正準 keyword で検証する
                                    # --record は item id 等の非機微参照だけを EDN に記録
                                    #   (ls による総当たり列挙を避けて狙い撃ちで引くため)
    kagi get <name>                 # secret を復号して stdout に出す
    kagi fill <name> --purpose <p> --selector <css> --cdp <ws>
                                    # ブラウザの入力欄へ直接注入(clipboard 不使用、
                                    # 値は argv にも JS 式にも載らない)
    kagi ls                         # item 一覧(復号しない)

passphrase は環境変数 KAGI_MASTER か端末プロンプト。
KAGI_UNLOCK_REF=keychain://... で device unlock ref を指定。
KAGI_IDENTITY_STORE=keychain で新規 identity 秘密鍵を Apple Keychain に保存。
鍵/vault は $KAGI_HOME(既定 ~/.kagi)。repo checkout の外なので checkout/worktree
