(ns kagi.sync
  "Cloud persistence for the kagi vault, iCloud-Keychain / 1Password style
  (ADR-2607170500). The vault snapshot is ALREADY end-to-end encrypted on disk
  (ciphertext items + wrapped VMK + ledger — `kagi.persist/->edn` emits no
  plaintext, no raw VMK), so pushing that exact blob to an untrusted server is
  safe: kotobase.net only ever holds ciphertext, and the master passphrase /
  OS-keychain VMK unlock never leaves the device. That is precisely the
  iCloud-Keychain trust model — the server is a sync relay, not a trust root.

  Transport: the encrypted snapshot is stored as a single upserted datom in the
  actor's own tenant graph `kotobase/db/<did>/kagi-vault` on kotobase.net,
  authorized by a depth-1 self-minted CACAO. The actor owns the graph by
  construction (graph CID = hash of its own DID + db-name), so no handed token
  and no coordination-server auth-key are needed.

    kagi push   local vault -> cloud (upsert snapshot under this actor's graph)
    kagi pull   cloud -> local vault (with a local backup first)
    kagi sync   pull-if-newer then push (last-writer-wins by :kagi.vault/seq)"
